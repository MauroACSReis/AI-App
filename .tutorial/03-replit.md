# Why Replit?

Replit is the best place on the internet to start building software.

One of the most annoying parts about learning to code is getting a development environment set up. We call these IDEs - integrated development environments. 

Doing this on your computer involves installing and setting up all sorts of software, and usually those steps are a bit tricky. This is tough for newcomers.

Luckily, Replit solves this for us!

They bring a powerful IDE right into the browser for us where all we need to do is create a new Repl (a project) and start writing our code.

They make it easy to:
- write code
- run it
- share it

Replit handles all of the annoying, tricky parts of setting up an IDE for us so that we can focus on building cool stuff without any of the headache.
