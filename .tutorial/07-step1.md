# Step 1: Import modules

The 1st thing you're going to do is import the libraries you'll be using.

In the `main.py` file, enter the following:

```python
import os
import openai
```

The 1st import gives you access to Python's built-in os module. You'll use this to import your OpenAI API key.

The 2nd import gives you access to the OpenAI library. This comes with some convenient methods to make requests to OpenAI.
