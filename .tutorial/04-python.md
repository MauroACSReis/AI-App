# What is Python?

In this course we'll be using Python.

It's a popular programming language known for its readability and clean syntax. There's an abundance of great resources on the internet to learn from, and the community is incredibly large.

This makes it a great 1st language to learn!

Python is particularly popular in AI, and learning Python means that you'll be able to use all of the most popular tools & libraries to help you build amazing AI apps.

We recommend [Replit's 100 Days of Code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/hub) to help you learn.

We'll cover everything you need to know for this project, but that's a great resource if you want to dive in deeper.
