# Congrats! ðŸ¥³

You did it!

You just wrote your 1st lines of Python and built a fully-functional Q&A bot using OpenAI!

For fun, try and see if you can add more functionality.

Already wanting to build more?

Keep up to date with [Takeoff School](https://www.takeoff.school/).

We're going to be releasing a whole lot more AI dev content soon.
